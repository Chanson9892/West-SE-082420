# Rainbow Tables
A rainbow table is a database that is used to gain authentication by cracking the password hash. It is a precomputed dictionary of plaintext passwords and their corresponding hash values that can be used to find out what plaintext password produces a particular hash. Since more than one text can produce the same hash, itâ€™s not important to know what the original password really was, as long as it produces the same hash.

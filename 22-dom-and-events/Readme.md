### innerText vs textContent 
[Kelly Norton's Blog](https://kellegous.com/j/2013/02/27/innertext-vs-textcontent/)

### .innerHTML
[The Risk of .innerHTML](https://medium.com/@jenlindner22/the-risk-of-innerhtml-3981253fe217#:~:text=innerHTML%20today%20is%20cross%2Dsite,cookies%20and%20other%20personal%20information.)
```
"One of the most prevalent risks of using Node.innerHTML today is cross-site scripting (XSS), which allows outside users to add malicious client-side scripts to websites that will be viewed by many users. Believing these scripts to be safe, their browsers will execute them, leaving the user vulnerable to theft of cookies and other personal information. If that isnâ€™t scary enough, these scripts can also change the actual content of the web page itself!"
